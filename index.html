  <h1><center>I originaly did not want to take this class. I knew I wanted to take my vapa this year though so I put photography first, film second and web design third. I was upset I did not get my first 2 choices and scared for web design. At first I thought the class would be just photo shop and things like that, so the coding caught me off gaurd. </center></h1>
